Question: in the phantom menace is padme the queen

Answer:
Yes

Context:
George Lucas, Rick McCallum, and casting director Robin Gurland auditioned over 200 actresses for the part of Padm√© Amidala. They chose 16-year-old actress Natalie Portman to play the role. According to The Phantom Menace production notes, ``The role required a young woman who could be believable as the ruler of that planet, but at the same time be vulnerable and open.'' Portman's performances in The Professional (1994) and Beautiful Girls (1996) impressed Lucas. He stated, ``I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia. Natalie embodied all those traits and more.''
