Question: are there any crocodiles native to north america

Answer:
Yes

Context:
Within the United States, the American crocodile's distribution is limited to the southern tip of Florida, though at least two have been found as far north as the Tampa Bay area. The current US population, estimated at 2,000, represents a significant recovery from a few hundred in the 1970s.
