Question: is job termination the same as being fired

Answer:
Yes

Context:
``Firing'' is a common colloquial term in the English language (particularly used in the U.S.) for termination. The term ``firing'' may have been initiated in the 1910s at the National Cash Register Company. Other terms for dismissal are being ``sacked'', ``canned'', ``let go'', ``ran-off'', ``axed'', ``given walking papers'', ``given the pink slip'' or ``boned''. Other terms, more often used in Commonwealth countries, include ``to get the boot'' and ``to get the sack''.
