Answer:
No

Context:
Cornus florida, the flowering dogwood, is a species of flowering plant in the family Cornaceae native to eastern North America and northern Mexico.

The tree is commonly planted as an ornamental in residential and public areas because of its showy bracts and interesting bark structure.
