Question: is it legal to carry a gun in nyc

Answer:
Yes

Context:
New York state law does not require a license to own or possess long guns, but does require a permit to legally possess or own a pistol. However, all firearms must comply with the NY SAFE Act, which bans guns considered ``assault weapons'' from ownership by private citizens, unless they were owned prior to the ban.
