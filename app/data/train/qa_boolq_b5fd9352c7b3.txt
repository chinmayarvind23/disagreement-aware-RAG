Question: does each australian state have its own constitution

Answer:
Yes

In Australia, each state has its own constitution. Each state constitution preceded the Constitution of Australia as constitutions of the then separate British colonies, but all the states ceded powers to the Parliament of Australia as part of federation in 1901.
